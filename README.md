### Starting the Application
1. Run the command `npm install`.
2. Run the command `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`.
3. Run the command `ng serve`.


## Contributing
As of the moment, no external contributions to this project will be accepted, as it is a learning exercise. However, your interest is appreciated. Keep an eye out for if this project develops into something more than that.
If you have a suggestion for improvements, you are free to open a ticket, but please note that those suggestions may or may not be taken into consideration during the development process.


## License
This project is not meant to be used by anyone else at this current time, and is thus not released under any particular license. All of the rights are currently reserved and belong to the development team, though that is likely to change in the future.

We do, however, believe in open-source as a philosophy, hence the reason this repo is viewable, and why the license is likely to change to be more permissive.

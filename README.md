# Projekt Monsterz
ðŸ“š An education platform for school-aged children to learn Computer Science concepts.
*Designed as part of the [Develop Carolina](https://www.developcarolina.org/) program.*


## Instructions
Currently, Projekt Monsterz requires the API and UI to be launched seperately. This will not be the case for much longer, but it's the case now.

### Setting up the Environment
First, it is recommended that you look at the `.env.example` file located in the root of the project. In order for the project to run, you will need a `.env` file in this same location with all of the same variables defined.

### Starting the API
1. Navigate to the `api` folder.
2. Run the command `npm install`.
3. Run the command `npm start`.

### Starting the UI
1. Navigate to the `ui` folder.
2. Run the command `npm install`.
3. Run the command `ng serve`.


## Contributing
As of the moment, no external contributions to this project will be accepted, as it is a learning exercise. However, your interest is appreciated. Keep an eye out for if this project develops into something more than that.
If you have a suggestion for improvements, you are free to open a ticket, but please note that those suggestions may or may not be taken into consideration during the development process.


## License
This project is not meant to be used by anyone else at this current time, and is thus not released under any particular license. All of the rights are currently reserved and belong to the development team, though that is likely to change in the future.
We do, however, believe in open-source as a philosophy, hence the reason this repo is viewable, and why the license is likely to change to be more permissive.

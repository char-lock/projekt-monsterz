This project is not meant to be used by anyone else at this current time,
and is thus not released under any particular license. All of the rights are
currently reserved and belong to the development team, though that is likely
to change in the future. We do, however, believe in open-source as a philosophy,
hence the reason this repo is viewable, and why the license is likely to change
to be more permissive.
